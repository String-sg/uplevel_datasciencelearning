    "Welcome to UpLevel DIY projects! In this series, you're challenged to independently work (with our guidance) with data that you will collect to UpLevel yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "We hope you're excited to embark on this adventure.\n",
    "### Warning:\n",
    "This isn't just any coding course or programmes, where you receive helper code as you move from one code block to another. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is when things get <em>real</em>.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will receive instructions to execute a task along with an intended outcome. Most importantly, we will provide you with directions you can go to, to pick up code independently and implement it in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry though, we'll be dropping lots of resources you can consult and these readings will contain everything you need to succeed. You can also perform independent research to find answers independently. You just have to read closely and pick out the parts that make most sense. \n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>We make you do this not because we're lazy bastards but because being able to indepedently find code is a highly underrated skill and that's something all companies look out for.</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're really stuck and are on the verge of giving up, we gotchu fam. Head on over to https://www.facebook.com/UpLevelSG/ and post your questions there. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What we'll be doing:\n",
    "In this project, we will do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download learning analytics data from OULAD and preview them (Part I)\n",
    "2. Perform data cleaning (Part II)\n",
    "3. Perform exploratory data analysis (Part III)\n",
    "4. Engineer new features (Part IV)\n",
    "5. Apply machine learning techniques to train a model to predict student dropout (Part V)\n",
    "6. Perform hyperparameter tuning to push model performance (Part V)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expectations:\n",
    "We're not going to sugarcoat it - it'll be challenging at times. You have to promise to put in the time and effort to UpLevel yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "But we promise you that it'll ultimately be fun and rewarding, and you'll come out of it stronger and more confident than before."
